# LDA Topic Modeling

This project showcases the application of **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modeling. LDA is a popular unsupervised learning technique used to discover abstract topics within a collection of text data.

## 🔍 What is LDA?

LDA assumes documents are a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words. It is widely used in text mining and NLP to extract hidden thematic structures in large text corpora.

These images visually represent the LDA workflow, from raw text data to topic extraction and final topic distributions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques (For full implementation)

- **Library**: Gensim / Scikit-learn
- **Text Processing**: NLTK / SpaCy
- **Visualization**: PyLDAVis / Matplotlib

## ✨ Use Cases

- Document classification
- Content recommendation
- Understanding large corpora
- Customer feedback analysis

Would you like me to provide a Python script that actually implements this process (e.g., Gensim-based LDA topic modeling) based on sample data? &#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;
